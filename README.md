## 🚀 What’s This All About?

This project is built for F1 nerds, stat lovers, and coding enthusiasts who want deep insight into driver performance, car behavior, and race dynamics — all in a slick, futuristic dashboard.

Using the [FastF1](https://github.com/theOehrly/Fast-F1) library, we tap into actual telemetry data like speed, throttle, gear shifts, and lap times — and turn it into interactive charts via a fast and lightweight frontend built in Preact.
